<p class="main_text">Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">Little White Bird</a> (1902),
    a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> ",
    Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington Gardens in London,
    where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between"
    a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre
    of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play">stage play</a>  titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a> , which premiered on
    27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of York's Theatre</a>  in London. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3"> <sup>[3]</sup></a> Following the success of the 1904 play,
    Barrie's publishers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_and_Stoughton">Hodder and Stoughton</a> , extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little
    White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a> ,
    with the addition of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a> . <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham"> <sup>[4]</sup></a> Barrie later adapted and expanded the
